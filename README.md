# Real-Time Traffic Management System

## Overview
This project is a real-time traffic management system designed to collect, process, and analyze traffic data, plan efficient routes, visualize traffic conditions on a map, and send alerts for traffic incidents or congestion.

## Features
- Collects real-time traffic data from various sources
- Analyzes traffic data to determine traffic conditions
- Implements Dijkstra's and A* algorithms for route planning
- Visualizes traffic data and routes on an interactive map
- Sends email and SMS alerts for traffic incidents
